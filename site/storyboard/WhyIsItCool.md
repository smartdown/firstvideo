# Why is Smartdown Cool?

Mostly a braindump of the key things that make Smartdown unique, or if not unique, *slightly better*, then alternatives.

- [Text-Based](:@TextBased)
- [Less Syntax, More Splainin'](:@SyntaxVsSplainin)
- [Collaboration-friendly](:@CollaborationFriendly)
- [Server-optional](:@ServerOptional)

# TextBased

## Text-based

One of the reasons I adopted the *clay* metaphor (e.g., InfoClay, ClayMirror, and QuantumClay) is the *permanence* of clay tablets (cf [Cuneiform](https://smartdown.site/#gallery/Cuneiform.md) and the possibility that ideas could expressed in a form that was *immortal*, rather than being locked up in proprietary formats or inaccessible systems. *Text is the universal language* was a phrase my former colleague used to use/quote.

Many times in the past I've expressed my ideas in various systems and they've been lost to time because the word processor or graphic program went out of business.


# SyntaxVsSplainin

## Less Syntax, More Splainin'

HTML syntax is overwhelming for normal humans, and even for some web developers.



# CollaborationFriendly
---

## Collaboration-friendly

Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Smartdown documents are very compatible with collaboration systems like GitHub and Glitch.com. This is because a Smartdown document is text (see above).


# ServerOptional
---

## No Server Required

Many systems require an internet connection to *author* and to *view* a document. For example, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter. Sometimes this is a necessary property (e.g., Python numpy doesn't yet run in a browser, or some big dataset won't *fit* in a browser); sometimes it is a business decision based upon [Vendor Lockin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) where the goal is to get a customer to invest their ideas and effort into a creation that is ultimately trapped in a particular vendor's system.
