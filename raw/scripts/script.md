- Dan Narrates all of this.

- Dejargonize this.

> Are you an Explainer? Do you have great ideas you want to share? Maybe you’re a teacher creating unique learning experiences for your students.  Maybe you’re a scientist who wants to share your research with your peers.  Maybe you’re a student who wants to share your science project.

- Dan speaking in front of his computer, skip to dan in front of classroom (tweed jacket?), skip to Dan in lab coat with science 	stuff in lab like environment.  Show Andre collecting water samples at Mt. Pisgah.

> The goal of Smartdown is to give explainers everywhere the tools they need to teach and share their knowledge and ultimately facilitate the open exchange of ideas.

- Back to Dan in front of computer.

> The obvious way to explain things is with words.  Writing is great and it’s easy to start a blog. You can even add a few pictures or a video to make your ideas clearer.

- Dan in front of computer.  Animation of words dropping into the frame from above.

- Screen capture of Wordpress adding pictures to blog post.

> But you’re not any ordinary explainer.  You want to give your audience something they can interact with.  A place where they can play, test hypotheses, answer questions, and explore.

- Wordpress screen shot wipes left.

- Video of user at computer using interactive smartdown app (wildthinks page?)

- screen capture:  exploding dots app, high five demo, Smartdown logo? playing with tree app, disclosable popup?  (our best screen candy)

> Unfortunately, you’re not a programmer or a web designer and you don’t have a bucket of money to pay a developer to implement your ideas.  (The problem is the system, not the author.)

- Can we get a real bucket of money?  Or do we do a drawing/animation or use monopoly money?

- With smartdown you don’t need a bucket of money for development.  You can create a compelling and interactive web page that’s written mostly in text.

> First a little background on web pages.  Most web pages are written in HTML.  Here’s some html code,  And here’s what that html code looks like when it gets rendered as a web page. You can see that HTML isn’t much fun to read or write.  Even web developers find it exhausting.


- show html for page left, rendered page on right


> Fortunately, there’s an easier way to write web pages.  You can use Markdown.  Here’s what you would write in Markdown to create the same page. Unlike HTML, it’s easy to read and write because it’s mostly text.  Markdown is used everywhere, from blogging systems like Wordpress to development tools like GitHub.   Here, let’s add a picture to this page.  We just paste in the url for the picture and it shows up. Easy.  Markdown also makes it easy to add links and videos to your pages.  Unfortunately, that’s where the power of markdown ends.

- Add a middle panel with Markdown. screen shot showing markdown and rendered page side by side.  Move in Wordpress and GitHub logos over screenshot.  Screen capture of adding a picture and it being rendered on right?


> Fortunately, that’s where Smartdown picks up.  Smartdown is an extension of Markdown so smartdown pages are text pages.  But Smartdown also makes  it easy to add interactive content such as charts, graphs, and featherweight programs called playables.  Currently, you can  include many well known web technologies into your page, and you can add them using simple text syntax.  Add D3, Plotly, P5JS apps for interactive dynamic visualization.  Use MathJax in your text for technical writing, add GraphViz drawings, or Plotly and Leaflet for mapping.  Smartdown also gives you a few simple ways to the control the formatting of your page and create pop windows all without complicated HTML tags.

- Need screen shots of all these things.

> The result is vibrant, interactive, explorable explanations that create a rich learning experience.  For you, that means Less Syntax and More ‘Splainin’.   Faster to produce.

Integrable
Smartdown is a flexible, open source web technology that can be used to embed other technology, and can also itself be embedded.


Collaboration-friendly
Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Smartdown documents are very compatible with collaboration systems like GitHub and Glitch.com. This is because a Smartdown document is text (see above).

No Server Required (so you can work offline)
Many systems require an internet connection to author and to view a document. For example, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter. Sometimes this is a necessary property (e.g., Python numpy doesn't yet run in a browser, or some big dataset won't fit in a browser); sometimes it is a business decision based upon Vendor Lockin where the goal is to get a customer to invest their ideas and effort into a creation that is ultimately trapped in a particular vendor's system.

How Smartdown can help change the world
My goals are to enable more people to express and teach their expertise and perspective via the web by creating a gradual slope between plain text and rich interactive explanations and understanding.

Great teaching needs to be sustained
I hope to help elementary and high school educators create useful and inspiring curricula and lessons, and to be able to share, and evolve these.
Ideally, mechanisms to allow these individual educators to monetize or fund them somehow so that they are sustainable.

Teachers: interview Heidi about wild thinks and smartdown.  Touch on contributing to open source project.

Kids can make smartdown pages.  Interview Andre about his mad lib page, science project page.

Openness and Permanance
Smartdown and its philosophy of adopting open standards and open source is intended to encourage and enable experts, scientists, educators and everyone to be able to share and evolve their contributions and be assured that they will not be subject to vendor lock-in.

LAB NOTES idea.  Smartdown can be used this way because its fast.
