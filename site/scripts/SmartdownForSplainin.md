## SmartdownForSplainin

The narrative theme outlined below is oriented around the idea that there are authors out there who are not web programmers, but want to create and show-and-tell their work via the web, and Smartdown provides that avenue. This was extracted from `script.md` and reformatted to make Voiceover vs Visuals more clear.

> Are you an Explainer? Do you have great ideas you want to share? Maybe you’re a teacher creating unique learning experiences for your students. Maybe you’re a scientist and you want to share your research with your peers. Maybe you’re a person who wants to share interactive experiences of your art or hobby.

> The goal of Smartdown is to give explainers everywhere the tools they need to teach and share their knowledge on the web.

> The obvious way to explain things is with words. Writing is great and it’s easy to start a blog. You can even add a few pictures or a video to make your ideas clearer.

> But you want to go further. You want to give your audience something they can interact with. A place where they can play, test hypotheses, answer questions, and explore.

> Currently, building this kind of interactive web content takes web developers, time and money, and the *idea* you want to get across and share is lost in the details of presenting your idea. For most people, this kind of content seems out of reach.

> We have built Smartdown you can create a compelling and interactive web page that’s written mostly in text. And, you can do it quickly and you can do it for free.

> First a little background on web pages. Here's what you write to make a web page. And here’s what people see when they look at this page in a web browser. Web pages are written in something called HTML, and as you can see, it isn’t much fun to read or write. Even web developers find it exhausting.

> Fortunately, there’s an easier way to write web pages. You can use Markdown. Here’s what you would write in Markdown to create the same page.

> Hmm. Which would you rather write?

> Markdown is used everywhere, from blogging systems like Wordpress to technology-oriented forums like GitHub and StackOverflow. Here, let’s add a picture to this page. We just paste in the url for the picture and it shows up. Easy. Markdown also makes it easy to add links and videos to your pages. Unfortunately, that’s where the power of markdown ends.

> Fortunately, that’s where Smartdown picks up. Smartdown is an extension of Markdown. Like Markdown, Smartdown pages are mostly text. But Smartdown also makes it easy to add interactive content such as charts, graphs, mathematical formatting and featherweight programs called playables.


- The interaction between cells, variables and playables. Need an example of this.


> Smartdown also gives you a few simple ways to the control the formatting of your page and create popup windows with an easy to use notation.


> The result is vibrant, interactive, explorable explanations that create a rich learning experience. For you, that means Less Syntax and More ‘Splainin’.
