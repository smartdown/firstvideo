# What is Smartdown?

Smartdown is a way to write technical and non-technical documents that are compelling and easy to share, publish and adapt. Smartdown is designed to enable non-technical folks to share, communicate, and teach. Smartdown simplifies the creation of *Explorable Explanations*, which are prose documents with embedded interactive content such as charts, graphs, and featherweight programs called *playables*.
