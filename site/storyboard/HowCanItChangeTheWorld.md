# How Smartdown can help change the world

My goals are to enable more people to express and teach their expertise and perspective via the web by creating a gradual slope between plain text and rich interactive explanations and understanding.

## The best way to learn is to teach

> The best way to learn is to teach
> - DoctorBud

I'd like teachers in schools (elementary school and beyond) to enable their students to create *explorable explanations* suitable for *show-and-tell*, rather than simple reports that are only viewed by the teacher. I hope this will inspire the student author and their peers to learn from each other, and perhaps even the teacher would learn something.

## Great teaching needs to be sustained

I hope to help elementary and high school educators create useful and inspiring curricula and lessons, and to be able to share, and evolve these.

Ideally, mechanisms to allow these individual educators to *monetize* or *fund* them somehow so that they are *sustainable*.

## Openness and Permanance

Smartdown and its philosophy of adopting open standards and open source is intended to encourage and enable experts, scientists, educators and everyone to be able to share and evolve their contributions and be assured that they will not be subject to vendor lock-in.
