### Card Index

This version of the presentation is basically for focusing on individual cards or Smartdown documents in the presentation, without the distraction of the Impress.js visuals.

Currently, you can go to a Card, and then use the `Index` button to get back to this index. At some point, I plan to add a next/previous card functionality, but not right now.
