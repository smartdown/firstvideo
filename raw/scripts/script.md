Are you an Explainer? Do you have great ideas you want to share? Maybe you’re a teacher creating unique learning experiences for your students.  Maybe you’re a scientist and you want to share your research with your peers.  Maybe you’re a student who wants to share your science project.

The goal of Smartdown is to give explainers everywhere the tools they need to teach and share their knowledge on the web.

The obvious way to explain things is with words.  Writing is great and it’s easy to start a blog. You can even add a few pictures or a video to make your ideas clearer.

But you’re not any ordinary explainer.  You want to give your audience something they can interact with.  A place where they can play, test hypotheses, answer questions, and explore.

Currently, building this kind of interactive web content takes web developers, time and money. For most people, this kind of content seems out of reach.  

But with smartdown you can create a compelling and interactive web page that’s written mostly in text. And, you can do it quickly and you can do it for free.

First a little background on web pages. Here's what you write to make a web page. And here’s what people see when they look at this page in a web browser. Web pages are written in something called HTML, and as you can see, it isn’t much fun to read or write.  Even web developers find it exhausting.

Fortunately, there’s an easier way to write web pages.  You can use Markdown.  Here’s what you would write in Markdown to create the same page. 
Hmm.  Which would you rather write?

Markdown is used everywhere, from blogging systems like Wordpress to development tools like GitHub.   Here, let’s add a picture to this page.  We just paste in the url for the picture and it shows up. Easy.  Markdown also makes it easy to add links and videos to your pages.  Unfortunately, that’s where the power of markdown ends.

Fortunately, that’s where Smartdown picks up.  Smartdown is an extension of Markdown.  Like Markdown, Smartdown pages are mostly text.  But Smartdown also makes  it easy to add interactive content such as charts, graphs, mathematical formatting and featherweight programs called playables.  

The interaction between cells and playables.  Need an example. of this.


Smartdown also gives you a few simple ways to the control the formatting of your page and create pop windows all without complicated HTML tags.

- Need screen shots of all these things.

Fast -> useful for quick stuff, LAB NOTES, all these things can have interactive elements.

The result is vibrant, interactive, explorable explanations that create a rich learning experience.  For you, that means Less Syntax and More ‘Splainin’.

Integrable
Smartdown is a flexible, open source web technology that can be used to embed other technology, and can also itself be embedded.


Collaboration-friendly
Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Smartdown documents are very compatible with collaboration systems like GitHub and Glitch.com. This is because a Smartdown document is text (see above).

No Server Required (so you can work offline)
> Many systems require an internet connection to author and to view a document. For example, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter. Sometimes this is a necessary property (e.g., Python numpy doesn't yet run in a browser, or some big dataset won't fit in a browser); sometimes it is a business decision based upon Vendor Lockin where the goal is to get a customer to invest their ideas and effort into a creation that is ultimately trapped in a particular vendor's system.

How Smartdown can help change the world
My goals are to enable more people to express and teach their expertise and perspective via the web by creating a gradual slope between plain text and rich interactive explanations and understanding.

Great teaching needs to be sustained
I hope to help elementary and high school educators create useful and inspiring curricula and lessons, and to be able to share, and evolve these.
Ideally, mechanisms to allow these individual educators to monetize or fund them somehow so that they are sustainable.

Teachers: interview Heidi about wild thinks and smartdown.  Touch on contributing to open source project.

Kids can make smartdown pages.  Interview Andre about his mad lib page, science project page.

Openness and Permanance
Smartdown and its philosophy of adopting open standards and open source is intended to encourage and enable experts, scientists, educators and everyone to be able to share and evolve their contributions and be assured that they will not be subject to vendor lock-in.

Cheese


LAB NOTES idea.  Smartdown can be used this way because its fast.
