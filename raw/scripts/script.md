- Need screen shots of all these things.

Fast -> useful for quick stuff, LAB NOTES, all these things can have interactive elements.

Integrable
Smartdown is a flexible, open source web technology that can be used to embed other technology, and can also itself be embedded.


Collaboration-friendly
Unlike Jupyter notebooks, Smartdown documents are very compatible with collaboration systems like GitHub and Glitch.com. This is because a Smartdown document is text (see above).

No Server Required (so you can work offline)
> Many systems require an internet connection to author and to view a document. For example, Google Docs, Evernote, Jupyter. Sometimes this is a necessary property (e.g., Python numpy doesn't yet run in a browser, or some big dataset won't fit in a browser); sometimes it is a business decision based upon Vendor Lockin where the goal is to get a customer to invest their ideas and effort into a creation that is ultimately trapped in a particular vendor's system.

How Smartdown can help change the world
My goals are to enable more people to express and teach their expertise and perspective via the web by creating a gradual slope between plain text and rich interactive explanations and understanding.

Great teaching needs to be sustained
I hope to help elementary and high school educators create useful and inspiring curricula and lessons, and to be able to share, and evolve these.
Ideally, mechanisms to allow these individual educators to monetize or fund them somehow so that they are sustainable.

Teachers: interview Heidi about wild thinks and smartdown.  Touch on contributing to open source project.

Kids can make smartdown pages.  Interview Andre about his mad lib page, science project page.

Openness and Permanance
Smartdown and its philosophy of adopting open standards and open source is intended to encourage and enable experts, scientists, educators and everyone to be able to share and evolve their contributions and be assured that they will not be subject to vendor lock-in.

LAB NOTES idea.  Smartdown can be used this way because its fast.
