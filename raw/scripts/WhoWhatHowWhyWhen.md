### Who, What, How, Why, When

Trying out different ways to fit Smartdown into 3-5 minutes. They are potentially different pitches for different audiences, but each has its own structure and logic (theoretically). Perhaps we can pick one for the video, or create a useful composite.

#### Who

> Hi, I'm Dan and I like to make things with software. Sometimes I do it for money, sometimes for the joy of experimenting and inventing. For the last 4 years, I've been creating a new kind of thing that am calling Smartdown.

> Although I myself am a computer scientist and veteran programmer, it is my mission to build technology that is accessible to a much more diverse set of creators, educators, learners, and sharers.


#### What

> Most of the web that we experience is made from *software building blocks* called *packages* (too technical!) that web authors *compose* to create an *experience*. Each of these building blocks (e.g., [d3]()) is specialized and powerful in a particular kind of expression (e.g., pie charts, music, )

> If you are familiar with Minecraft, then most web applications are built from a set of blocks of different types.

> Smartdown is an unusual *block*. It resembles cheese, which is itself wonderful. However, you can put stuff in cheese; and you can put cheese in stuff.

> Smartdown is a vehicle for more easily exploring the composition of different web technologies, and is targeted towards creators and explainers who want to create an experience, but are not willing/capable/expert in expressing that experience via traditional syntax-heavy mechanisms (too geeky still).


##### How

> Many people, not just software developers, are now familiar with Markdown, which is a means of writing *mostly text* documents, but still retaining the ability to format text, lists, tables and to embed images, links, and other media.

> I'm a big fan of Markdown; and I'm not alone. GitHub, Gitter, and even Facebook Messenger embrace Markdown (sadly, Slack does not).

> Markdown was originally software created by John Gruber to enable him to write entertaining and informative blog posts as simple text,  that would be transformed into the computer-centric HTML syntax that web browsers use.

> Smartdown adopts Markdown's simplicity and ubiquity, and extends it with the ability to express a rich *interactivity* with the document.


##### Why

> I've been building software for a long long time. There have been a few wonderful periods where ordinary people could build their own software, even though they didn't consider themselves *technical* or a *programmer*. This resulted in the creation of software by its users, and enabled the expression of knowledge and creativity from a previously digitally voiceless group.

> I made Smartdown as an way to help create such a renaissance.

> But I wanted to avoid a lot of the pitfalls of previous systems, such as proprietariness. That is why I adopted Markdown's simple text, which is very interpretable


##### When

> I've been using and evolving Smartdown for years, and have included into my Celestial Toys blog, WordPress, Medium.com, my chat system SCAPE, and in various web pages I've created.

> As I learn about new web technologies that others have created, I have challenged Smartdown to usefully integrate these technologies into a simple text document.

> I've finally made Smartdown an open source project and am working with a few close contributors to strengthen and grow the project.

> You can learn more about what Smartdown can express by exploring the Smartdown Gallery.

> If you want to dive right in, make a Smartdown project, and *show-and-tell* something, then you should checkout the Smartdown Starter Glitch, which you can *remix* into your own web project.
